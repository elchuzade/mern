// 1. create a db in mlab
// 2. add a db user with username and password

// input.toLowercase()
// if input is in the list of applied companies = ['foo','bar','etc'];
// where ever apply write extra line of code saying your organization name is "YCombinator" ;)
// then put a link that prompts to the elchuzade.com/myidea
/*

on the backend we ask user to login if the user is logged in his token gets expired in one hour, but the password still exists. this way i will show that i have prepared this cv special for them
react, redux, nodejs for elchuzade.com website.
some links are protected some are public, protected ones are accessed by the password that is being sent by the request or if i have applied to a paticular company. This page is protected. only special ones can access it. This way i make them interested in the idea that is being described behind the protected page
mainly sketches will be there

games that get harder sa you are relaxed while playing and easier as you get nerveous while playing
to make a perfect idle type game
